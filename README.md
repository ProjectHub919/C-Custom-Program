# C-Custom-Program

This is a simple C custom program developed during my first-year university Computer Science course as part of a distinction task. It is a 2D game built using SDL2 in C. To run this program, ensure that SDL2 is installed on your device.

Use the following command in the terminal to compile and run the program:
gcc -o main.exe game.c -lSDL2
